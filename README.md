This project explores the use of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models to predict the virality of TikTok videos based on various metrics like video shares, likes, comments, download counts, video duration, and verified status of the user. The project also provides insights into which factors contribute the most to video virality, offering a data-driven approach to understanding TikTok trends.

It includes:

A Linear Regression model for predicting video view count.
A Random Forest Regressor model to determine the importance of different features in video virality.
Visualization of predicted vs actual views and feature importance.
This project is divided into separate modules for easy understanding and modular design.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
